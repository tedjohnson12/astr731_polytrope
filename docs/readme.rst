Polytrope Solver for my ASTR 731 Numerical Assignment
=====================================================

Solve a polytrope with :math:`n` between 0 and 4
using the shooting method.

This has become a bit of a Frankenrepo.

It has
#. A Python package
#. A Rust crate
#. A showyourwork article

Hopefully they all are nice to each other.
